**** Plot macro for electron backscattering coefficients ***
The macro produces backscattering coefficient plots in two energy range and with respect to different experimental datasets.
The default mode (flag #5 set to 0) shows simulations vs Sandia80 and Neubert data for the various materials and angles between 0.032 and 1.033 MeV. Plot 1 shows SS, GS, Opt0 and Opt3 vs Sandia and Neubert. Plot 2 shows SS vs Sandia (upper part) and SS/Sandia (lower part). 
Setting flag #5 to 1 the lower energy range is shown. SS and GS are compared with respect to several experimental datasets in the eV - keV energy range. Those simulations are performed with higher statistic.
The input files are taken from:
a) ../results/ for simulation results (ASCII format)
b) ../data/ for experimental data (.tsv format)
(these paths are by default written into the code, have to recompile if changed)

Output files are saved into ./plot subdirectory into .png format.


1) To compile use the makefile (needs root libraries)

2) Executable to run: ./plotpowrat_numfrac
   Options: 
   # 1 material (Al, Be, C, Mo, Ta, Ti, U)
   # 2 angle (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75) 
   # 3 number or energy (n/e)
   # 4 display Sandia article theoretical points
   # 5 display C. Joy database  -- (Only for Al at the moment)
   # 6 Draw canvas on screen?

Example:
./plotpowrat_numfrac Al 0 n 0 1 1

NOTE: Be has different angles (1, 16, 31, 46, 61, 76), but you have to launch the macro with the usual angles. The scripts -only for Be- increment those values of 1.
